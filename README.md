# CSinSchools

This is the repo for all the teaching resources used for my teaching project as part of the Communicating Computer Science in Schools module at Imperial College London.
The commit dates should be clear and visible. 

The teaching project itself was a crash course in machine learning, the content covered some of the basics of machine learning, ranging from what supervised learning is to getting students to implement their own simple linear regression model from scratch.
