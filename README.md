This is the repo for all the teaching resources used for my teaching project as part of the Communicating Computer Science in Schools module at Imperial College London.
The commit dates should be clear and visible. 

The teaching project itself was a crash course in machine learning, the content covered some of the basics of machine learning, ranging from what supervised learning is to getting students to implement their own simple linear regression model from scratch.

General Outline of each week:
* Week 1 - Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, Classification vs Regression (both year 13s and year 10/11s). Did not get time to do worksheet questions or slido quiz, decided to simply discuss some of the questions with the class instead of giving them these individually through the quiz or worksheet.
* Week 2 - Review of previous week, Live Coding Demo to show previous week's concepts in practice, started looking at simple linear regression. Started working through some workbook questions. (Both year 13s and year 10/11s)
* Week 3 - Year 13s missed lesson. For year 10s, did our first slido quiz, then continued simple linear regression slides from previous week. Adapted lesson completely on the spot to teach differentiation basics, Year 10s had not covered differentiation in their maths lessons yet. Very whiteboard based interactive lesson.
* Week 4 - This was first week back after half-term. Recap with year 13s as well as continuation of simple linear regression slides. Moved onto discussing gradient descent, gave them the challenge to try and derive one of the formulas. For year 10s, another slido quiz but today was much longer than last week. Then continued from where we left off on differentiation last week. Looked into differentiation from first principles and a more intuitive understanding of differentiation and how it links to gradients.
* Week 5 - Year 13s missed lesson. For year 10s, did another slido quiz covering concepts previously seen, took up most of the lesson. Wrapped up differentiation, linked it to gradient descent and started going through the slides of how to implement simple linear regression from scratch, this prepared students for what they would be doing next week.
* Week 6 - Pivoted with the year 13s, did a lesson on problem solving using coding. Looked at the two-sum problem on leetcode, discussed possible approaches and a general algorithm, students were then asked to translate this algorithm to code by themselves. For Year 10s, they began implementing a Simple Linear Regression model from scratch. Very practical and interactive lesson that translated all concepts and ideas covered in earlier weeks to practical coding. Did a very quick slido quiz with the year 10s at the end which was actually intended to be given to the year 13s.
* Week 7 - I will be going in for an extra week after the deadline.

Note: The slides are the same for Week 2, 3 and 4. The slides for week 5 and week 6 have some overlap but are not the same.
